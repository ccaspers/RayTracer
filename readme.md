# Simple Raytracer
Created as an exercise for 'generative computer-graphics' at my college.

## Features
* configurable phong-materials
* multiple, colored lights
* recursive calculation of reflections
* simple shadows

## Drawbacks
* no antialiasing
* unoptmizied (aka. slow) rendering
* no support for 3d-object-files
